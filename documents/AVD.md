## Objective
- Develop and present an AI-powered educational platform version with multilingual support, analytics, data protection, and scalable microservices architecture for lecture-based learning.

## Status
- In Progress

## Execution Summary
- The platform provides secure lecture management, AI-powered summaries and quizzes, and RAG-based chat over lecture data.
- Architecture is designed as microservices: `auth-service` (Go), `content-service` (FastAPI), `ai-service` (FastAPI), and `frontend` (React/Next.js).
- Core data layer combines PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO object storage, vector DB (Qdrant), and message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ) to support transactional, cached, semantic, and async workloads.
- Deployment targets AWS with HTTPS-first networking, observability, and CI/CD automation.

## High-Level Description
- This project is an AI-powered educational platform that lets users upload lectures (PDF/audio), browse lecture content, chat with AI using RAG, generate summaries, and create quizzes.
- Users consume content and AI features, while platform operators manage content lifecycle and platform operations.
- The platform addresses fragmented study materials and low learning efficiency by centralizing content and automating learning artifacts.

## Key Decisions
- Microservices over monolith for domain isolation and independent scaling.
- AI capabilities are provided through a dedicated AI service to decouple business logic from model orchestration.
- JWT-based authentication with access/refresh token model.
- Vector retrieval via Qdrant for RAG context selection.
- MinIO is used as object storage for lecture files and generated artifacts.
- API-first contracts between frontend and backend services.
- Event-driven async processing for heavy AI tasks (indexing, long summaries, audio generation).
- Kafka is used for indexing API event flow.
- RabbitMQ is used for agent (RAG) invocation flow.

## Key Risks
- Low-quality source lecture files can reduce retrieval quality.
  - Mitigation: preprocessing, normalization, chunking strategy, ingestion validation.
- AI response latency can degrade user experience.
  - Mitigation: caching, prompt constraints, async workflows with job tracking.
- Rapid usage growth can pressure vector and AI inference layers.
  - Mitigation: horizontal autoscaling and queue-based workload smoothing.
- Data privacy risks for uploaded educational content.
  - Mitigation: encryption in transit/at rest, strict RBAC, audit trails.

## Architectural Drivers

### Business Goals
- Improve user learning efficiency with searchable and interactive lecture knowledge.
- Reduce manual effort for summary and quiz creation.
- Provide scalable architecture for future user and content growth.
- Ensure secure and compliant handling of educational data.

### Major Features
- Secure registration/login and profile stats.
- Lecture CRUD and metadata/content access.
- Lecture-to-vector ingestion workflow.
- RAG chat with context-aware responses.
- Summary generation and quiz generation per lecture.

### Design Constraints
- Initial target: up to 10 concurrent users in prototype stage, extensible to 100 users.
- Cost efficiency: prioritize managed/open-source services with clear scaling limits.
- Security by design: encrypted transport and storage, token-based auth.
- Modularity: independent deployment of services.

### Architectural Concerns
- AI inference latency and throughput.
- Search relevance and chunk quality in vector DB.
- API consistency across services.
- Observability for distributed tracing and incident response.

## Quality Attributes and Quality Attribute Scenarios

### Security
- Attribute: all external/internal traffic is HTTPS; sensitive data is encrypted at rest.
- Scenario: when an unauthorized token accesses lecture content, API returns `401/403`, and event is logged for audit.

### RBAC (Minimal Policy)
- Access model: authenticated users + restricted operator actions.
- Authenticated users: read existing lecture content and use own chat interactions with AI.
- Restricted operator actions: content upload/update/delete and AI generation triggers.
- Access rule: user chat access is limited to own chats.

### Performance
- Attribute: average interactive operations return within acceptable UX thresholds.
- Scenario: under 10 concurrent active users, RAG chat responds within target SLA through caching and retrieval optimization.

### Availability and Reliability
- Attribute: service-level high availability with fault isolation.
- Scenario: if `ai-service` pod/task fails, orchestrator replaces instance without affecting auth/content service availability.

### Scalability
- Attribute: horizontal scaling of stateless services.
- Scenario: during exam periods, chatbot and quiz traffic spikes are handled by independently scaling `ai-service`.

### Usability
- Attribute: streamlined, low-friction user workflow.
- Scenario: a platform operator uploads a lecture, then a user reads content and starts RAG chat in a single guided flow.

## Solution Architectures

### System Context View
- Actors:
  - User: consumes lecture content and AI learning outputs.
  - Platform Operator: manages lecture content quality and platform operations.
  - External AI provider/model runtime: executes language tasks.
  - Cloud infrastructure: hosts services, storage, and monitoring stack.

## Service API Catalog

### API Governance
- Base URL: `/api/v1`
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` for protected endpoints.
- Token model: short-lived access token + refresh token.
- Common error envelope:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Lecture not found",
    "request_id": "req_12345"
  }
}
```

### Frontend API Integration Contract
- Frontend calls backend through gateway under `/api/v1`.
- Auth flows:
  - Login/register pages call auth APIs, tokens stored with secure strategy.
- Lecture flows:
  - Lecture dashboard uses list/get/add/delete/rename endpoints.
- AI flows:
  - Lecture details page invokes indexing, summary, quiz, and RAG chat endpoints.

## Logs / Monitoring / Alerting / CI/CD

### Logs
- Structured JSON logs with `request_id`, `user_id`, `service`, `latency_ms`, `error_code`.
- Centralized ingestion from all services into cloud log platform.
- Audit logs for authentication events and privileged actions.

### Monitoring
- API metrics: request rate, latency percentiles, error rate.
- Service metrics: CPU, memory, restart count, queue depth.
- AI metrics: model latency, token usage, retrieval hit quality, job durations.
- Data metrics: DB connection saturation, cache hit rate, vector index health.

### Alerting
- Severity-based alert policies:
  - Critical: auth outage, gateway 5xx spikes, DB unavailability.
  - High: AI latency breach, indexing job backlog.
  - Medium: elevated retries and error trends.
- Alert channels: Slack/email/on-call routing.

### CI/CD
- Branch strategy:
  - `dev` -> auto deploy to stage.
  - release tags `vX.Y.Z` -> deploy to production.
- Pipeline steps:
  - Lint, test, SAST, build image, push registry, deploy IaC/application, post-deploy health checks.
