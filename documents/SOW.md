# SOW Pilot | Digital Clinical Protocols with AI Support | Freedom Cloud | Ministry of Health

## Author

## 1. Project Overview and Context
- This Scope of Work (SOW) defines the technical implementation scope for the pilot `Digital Clinical Protocols with AI Support` on Freedom Cloud for the Ministry of Health.
- The SOW is based on the target architecture and service boundaries documented in `AVD.md` and the project baseline in `pm_project_overview.md`.
- The pilot uses a microservices architecture:
  - `auth-service` (Go)
  - `content-service` (FastAPI)
  - `ai-service` (FastAPI)
  - `frontend` (React/Next.js, TypeScript)
- For domain alignment, the core content entity is interpreted as:
  - `lecture` in current APIs = `clinical protocol document` in pilot business context.

## 2. Objectives and Measurable Outcomes
### 2.1 Objectives
- Deliver a secure and observable pilot for protocol ingestion, retrieval, and AI-assisted interactions.
- Validate AI workflows for protocol Q&A, summarization, and quiz/assessment generation.
- Prove technical readiness for production scaling using the same service decomposition.

### 2.2 Measurable Outcomes (Pilot KPIs)
- Availability: >= 99.0% monthly for pilot environment runtime window.
- Performance:
  - P80 synchronous API response <= 3 seconds (non-AI endpoints).
  - P80 RAG response <= 10 seconds.
- Security:
  - 100% protected endpoints require JWT authentication and access control checks.
  - 100% data in transit via HTTPS/TLS.
- Quality:
  - RAG answers include source chunk references.
  - Summary and quiz generation complete successfully for >= 90% valid inputs.

## 3. In-Scope Technical Work
### 3.1 Service Implementation Scope
- Implement and integrate:
  - identity and token lifecycle APIs in `auth-service`.
  - protocol document lifecycle APIs in `content-service`.
  - AI indexing and generation APIs in `ai-service`.
  - user flows in `frontend` for protocol upload, browsing, and AI actions.

### 3.2 API Scope (from AVD/API Catalog)
- Auth APIs:
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`
  - `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`
  - `GET /api/v1/auth/me`
- Content APIs:
  - `POST /api/v1/lectures`
  - `DELETE /api/v1/lectures/{lecture_id}`
  - `PATCH /api/v1/lectures/{lecture_id}`
  - `GET /api/v1/lectures/{lecture_id}/content`
  - `GET /api/v1/lectures`
- AI APIs:

  - `POST /api/v1/ai/lectures/{lecture_id}/summaries`
  - `POST /api/v1/ai/lectures/{lecture_id}/quizzes`

### 3.3 Data and Storage Scope
- PostgreSQL: users, content metadata, quiz records.
- Redis: caching and latency optimization.
- Qdrant: vector embeddings and semantic retrieval index.
- S3-compatible storage: source documents and generated artifacts.

### 3.4 Observability and Operations Scope
- Structured service logs with request and trace correlation IDs.
- Core dashboards for latency, error rate, throughput, queue/job status.
- Alert routing to operational channels for critical incidents.

## 4. Out-of-Scope Boundaries
- Full nationwide rollout and multi-tenant production hardening.
- Clinical decision automation or diagnosis recommendations.
- Integration with all external hospital/EMR systems in pilot phase.
- Dedicated mobile applications (iOS/Android native).
- Custom foundation model training/fine-tuning pipeline.

## 5. Solution Architecture and Technical Design
### 5.1 Architecture Pattern
- API-first microservices with separate auth/content/AI concerns.
- Stateless service runtime with horizontal scaling capability.
- Managed or self-hosted data components for transactional and semantic workloads.

### 5.2 Logical Flow
1. User authenticates via `auth-service` and receives JWT tokens.
2. Platform operator uploads protocol content via `content-service`.
3. User accesses available lectures via `content-service`.
4. AI indexing job stores embeddings in Qdrant.
5. User asks protocol question via RAG API.
6. `ai-service` retrieves context from Qdrant and produces grounded answer.
7. Optional summary/quiz outputs generated and stored.

### 5.3 Deployment Model
- Environments: `stage` and `prod`.
- Public entry: ALB/API gateway over HTTPS.
- Services and data layers deployed in private subnets/network zones where applicable.
- CI/CD-driven deployments with release promotion rules.

## 10. Integration and Data Requirements
### 10.1 Internal Service Integration
- `frontend` -> `auth-service`, `content-service`, `ai-service` via `/api/v1`.
- `ai-service` -> Qdrant, Redis, object storage, and metadata store.
- `content-service` -> object storage and PostgreSQL (`lectures` and related metadata).

### 10.2 Data Requirements
- Mandatory metadata fields: title, owner, language, created timestamp, version status.
- Content ingestion supports document-oriented payloads (PDF and text-first formats in pilot).
- Retention and deletion policies must support controlled purge for pilot data lifecycle.

## 11. Security, Compliance, and Risk Controls
### 11.1 Security Controls
- JWT access/refresh token model with expiration and refresh rotation.
- Access control middleware on all protected routes:
  - restricted operator actions for content write and AI generation triggers.
  - authenticated user access for read flows and own chat interactions.
- HTTPS/TLS on all external and service communication paths.
- Encryption at rest for object and database storage.
- Audit logging for privileged actions and auth events.

### 11.2 Compliance and Privacy Assumptions
- Pilot data is handled with least-privilege access and environment isolation.
- Any handling of sensitive clinical data requires approved governance policy and legal review.

### 11.3 Risk Register (Pilot Technical)
- Retrieval quality risk due to poor source documents.
  - Mitigation: ingestion validation and chunking optimization.
- AI latency risk under peak load.
  - Mitigation: caching, async processing, autoscaling plan.
- Integration drift risk between frontend and backend contracts.
  - Mitigation: versioned API contracts and automated integration tests.

## 12. Quality Assurance and Testing Strategy
- Unit testing on core service logic and validation layers.
- API contract tests for auth/content/AI endpoints.
- Integration tests for storage, vector indexing, and RAG flow.
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys.
