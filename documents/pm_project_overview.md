1. Project Title
AI-Powered Educational Platform for Lectures, Summaries, and Quizzes
2. Topic Area
Education Technology (EdTech), AI Systems, and Enterprise Software
3. Problem Statement
Users often have access to lecture files, but they lack tools for structured learning, fast
revision, and interactive understanding.Educational content is usually scattered across
formats (PDF, audio, notes), making it hard to search and study efficiently.Manual creation of
summaries and quizzes is time-consuming for content teams and learners.This results in
lower learning efficiency and reduced engagement.
4. Proposed Solution
We propose a distributed microservice-based educational platform where users can upload
lecture files (PDF/audio), view lecture content, and receive AI-generated summaries and
quizzes.The system includes secure authentication, lecture content management, AI
processing (text extraction, embeddings, RAG chat), and a user-friendly frontend
dashboard.This approach reduces study time, improves comprehension, and provides
personalized learning support.
5. Target Users
· Users (`user` role): read existing lectures, use RAG chat, consume summaries/quizzes
· Platform operators: upload/manage content, run indexing, manage platform data
6. Technology Stack
Frontend: React (or Next.js), TypeScript, HTML/CSS
Backend:
· Service 1: Auth & Users (Go)
· Service 2: Content & Business Logic (FastAPI)
· Service 3: AI Service (FastAPI, NLP pipeline)
Database: PostgreSQL (metadata, users, quiz results), Redis (cache), Vector DB (Qdrant)
Cloud / Hosting: AWS (EC2/ECS/EKS), S3-compatible object storage, HTTPS-enabled
deployment
APIs / Integrations: JWT auth, AI model APIs (LLM/STT), internal service-to-service
REST APIs
Other Tools: Docker, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), centralized logging (ELK/EFK),
monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
7. Key Features
· User registration/login with JWT (access + refresh) and profile statistics
· Access control for read-only users and restricted operator actions
·Lecture upload, storage, metadata management, and download
· AI-generated lecture summaries and quiz generation
·RAG-based lecture chat with source-referenced answers

9. Expected Outcome
A working prototype of a scalable educational platform with: secure authentication, lecture
management, AI summary/quiz generation, and an interactive RAG chat interface for
lecture-based learning.
